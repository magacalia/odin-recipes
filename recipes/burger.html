        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g of ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
            <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of black pepper</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>Pickle slices</li>
            <li>1 small onion, sliced (optional)</li>
            <li>Condiments of choice (e.g., ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the ground beef with salt and black pepper. Divide into 4 equal portions and form into round patties, about 2 cm thick.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they reach your preferred doneness. Place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
            <li>Lightly toast the burger buns on the skillet or grill for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burger by layering lettuce, the beef patty with melted cheese, tomato slices, pickles, and onion on the bottom half of the bun. Add condiments to taste.</li>
            <li>Top with the other half of the bun and serve immediately.</li>
